#### Programming Questions

Question:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a sQuestion 2



Question:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
40320


Question:
Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
without,hello,bag,world
Then, the output should be:
bag,hello,without,world

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.


Question:
A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
Following are the criteria for checking the password:
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
Example
If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
Then, the output of the program should be:
ABd1234@1

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solutions:
import re
value = []
items=[x for x in raw_input().split(',')]
for p in items:
    if len(p)<6 or len(p)>12:
        continue
    else:
        pass
    if not re.search("[a-z]",p):
        continue
    elif not re.search("[0-9]",p):
        continue
    elif not re.search("[A-Z]",p):
        continue
    elif not re.search("[$#@]",p):
        continue
    elif re.search("\s",p):
        continue
    else:
        pass
    value.append(p)
print ",".join(value)


Question:
You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
1: Sort based on name;
2: Then sort based on age;
3: Then sort by score.
The priority is that name > age > score.
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
Tom,19,80
John,20,90
Jony,17,91
Jony,17,93
Json,21,85
Then, the output of the program should be:
[('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]
